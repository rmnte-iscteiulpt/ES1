Software Observations:
When compiling the results, namely the .eps and .r file, the program exports the results into the location of the .jar file, or the root of the classpath.
When the software generates the configuration through the algorithm, it blocks the interface as there's no separate threads making the algorithm run.
The jUnitTests are located inside the src folder.
